## CRM Art and Architectural Argumentation Repository Description ##

This repository exists to provide a point of access for users to download the stable releases of the CRM Art and Architectural Argumentation ontology (CRMaaa).

This repository is maintained through a collaboration between:

the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en.html)
Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)
CRMaaa is an extension of the CIDOC CRM standard (https://www.cidoc-crm.org) designed to support the representation of historical data not easily represented using that base standard. It introduces the key concepts of institutional fact and speech act in order to support the representation of socially grounded yet objective historical facts. For details of this modelling pattern and strategy please refer to the specification and surrounding documentation.

The CRMaaa extension is developed and maintained using the OntoMe tool. The project space for CRMaaa can be found here:

https://ontome.net/project/69

Changes to the ontology are managed through that tool. Official releases, as of version 1.5, are created systematically through the automatic generation of specification and rdfs files from OntoMe.

Discussions, suggestions and queries relative to the ontology should be raised using the issues feature of this repository.

In this repository users will find the different stable versions of CRMaaa which can be used for creating, managing and querying semantic data using the CIDOC CRM and CRMaaa ontologies. Each release includes at least a specification document in pdf format, explaining the ontology, and an rdfs file which enables its implementation as a semantic web ontology in rdfs supporting platforms and systems.
